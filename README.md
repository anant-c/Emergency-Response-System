# Emergency Response System

This project aims to develop a dual-triggered emergency response system using the ESP8266 microcontroller for vehicles. The system can be activated manually through a push button 
or automatically through sensor data indicating an accident. Upon activation, the system sends an SOS email with the driverâ€™s current GPS location to the authorities, ensuring prompt assistance. 
By integrating GPS, ultrasonic, vibration, and gyrosensors, the system provides a comprehensive solution for enhancing road safety and security in various emergency situations.
**This project aligns itself with The United Nations Software Development Goals (SDG) 11 i.e. "Sustainable cities and communities"** since improving emergency response mechanisms for drivers, 
can be inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable.

## Features

- Dual-triggered system.
- Send SOS with accurate GPS location to concerned authorities.
- Analyses data from multiple sensors including Ultrasonic sensor, Gyro sensor, Vibration sensor to detect accidents.
- Threshold based accident detection algorithm.

## Components used

- **ESP8266**:  Low-cost Wi-Fi microcontroller, with built-in TCP/IP networking software, and microcontroller capability.
